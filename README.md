## 1. Purpose
We wanted to provide some guidelines on what Big Data Innovation Team code repositories should contain and how they should be structured. This section should contain the goal(s) of the project and a roadmap of how they will or have been achieved. 

## 2. How to use
This section would typically explain how someone can use the information in the repository for their own purposes. If the project features atomic submodules (like the [data sources repository](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_data-sources)), this section should give a higher-level overview of the purpose of each folder within the repository and then each subfolder should have its own README that would also be in this style. The most specific README should include information about the different languages used and external dependencies, if any, and how to acquire them. 

You can use the contents of this README and repository as a guide when [creating your own repository](https://github.com/new), or you can jump to how to [Fork this Repository](#Fork-this-repository).

If create a repo manually

## 3. How to contribute

We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the public and other agencies! A good first step would be to open an issue with the [![question](img/question_label.PNG) label](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_template/labels/question) requesting more information about the project. 

Internally, as our projects become more complex, we may have better ideas of best practices for organizing info. Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, or edit this repository directly. Maybe someday create a [`CONTRIBUTING.md` template file](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/) ([see issue](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_template/issues/2))
