# Sub Task 1
This folder contains the code necessary to complete Sub Task 1.

## Purpose
Large projects can have distinct, atomized sub-tasks. These folders are where they should go.

## How to Use
Split code up by programming language, if that makes sense, and then explain how to use the code in each subfolder.

## How to Contribute
*This section should probably contain the same info as the higher level README, but... maybe not! And maybe someone will come to this README and it will be so complete that they won't need to read the upper level README, so copy and paste necessary information here* 

We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the public and other agencies! A good first step would be to open an issue with the [![question](img/question_label.PNG) label](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_template/labels/question) requesting more information about the project. 

Internally, as our projects become more complex, we may have better ideas of best practices for organizing info. Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, or edit this repository directly. Maybe someday create a [`CONTRIBUTING.md` template file](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/) ([see issue](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_template/issues/2))
